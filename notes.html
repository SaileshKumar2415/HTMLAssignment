        <h2 class="text-center">Web Programming</h2>
        <p class="content-justify"> Web programming encompasses all the writing, markup, and code that goes into Web
            development, including Web content, client and server scripting, and network security. XML, HTML,
            JavaScript, Perl 5, and PHP are the most often used languages for Web programming. Web programming is
            distinct from traditional programming in that it necessitates a broad understanding of the application
            domain, client and server scripting, and database technologies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-10">
        <h2 class="text-center">Front End Development</h2>
        <p class="content-justify">The front end of a website is the section that the user interacts with directly. It
            is sometimes referred to as the application's "client side." Everything that users see directly is included:
            text colors and styles, photos, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and the navigation menu. The languages
            used for Front End development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-10">
        <h2 class="text-center">Backend Development</h2>
        <p class="content-justify">Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data and makes sure
            everything on the client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot see
            and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. The
            parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a
            front-end application. Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components
            without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend.</p>
        <p class="content-justify">Backend Languages: PHP, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Node.js.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-10">
        <h2 class="text-center">Full Stack Developer</h2>
        <p class="content-justify">Full Stack Developer is a software expert who’s equally proficient in frontend
            (client-side) development and backend (server-side) development. Full Stack Developers have a broad skill
            set and extensive knowledge base. Thus, one needs years of experience in software development to earn the
            title of a Full Stack Developer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-10">
        <h2 class="text-center">Web Technologies</h2>
        <p class="content-justify">Web technology is how computers communicate with one another using markup languages
            and multimedia packages. It allows us to interact with hosted information, such as websites. The use of
            hypertext markup language (HTML) and cascading style sheets is part of web technology (CSS).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-10">
        <h2 class="text-center">Web development</h2>
        <p class="content-justify">Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that
            happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast, and perform well with a seamless user
            experience.</p>
        <p class="content-justify">Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The
            languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are
            working. Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great
            career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional
            university degree to become qualified.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p-10">
        <h2 class="text-center">Hyper Text Markup Language</h2>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p class="content-justify">HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This is the standard markup language for
            creating Web pages and describes the structure of a Web page. It consists of a series of elements that tell
            the browser how to display the content.</p>
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p class="content-justify">
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,
            paper, or in other media. It saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at
            once External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.
        </p>
        <h2>h1 to h6 tags</h2>
        <li>Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for a document
            automatically.</li>
        <li>We can resize the text using CSS “font-size” property.</li>
        <li>Avoid skipping heading levels and always try to use h1 fallowed by h2 and so on.</li>
        <li>Using more than one h1 is not considered as best practice.</li>
        <li>It must have the starting and the ending tags.</li>
        <h2>Thematic Break (hr - horizontal break)</h2>
        <p class="content-justify">Historically, this has been presented as a horizontal rule or line. While it may
            still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, this element is now defined in semantic terms,
            rather than presentational terms, so if you wish to draw a horizontal line, you should do so using
            appropriate CSS.</p>
